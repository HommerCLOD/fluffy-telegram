Hi, It is a simple tool to download comix and images from https://telegra.ph
The bot creates a folder with the title of article and numerates all images

You must have **node.js** installed

How to set up:
1. Clone this repo using git clone or download a ZIP

2. Open this folder in CMD or IDE and run ***npm i*** to install packages

3. Next you need to fill ***links.json*** all https://telegra.ph with your need ( PLS be careful with commas and double quotes, you need to fill this file with JSON standards)

4. If done with all previous steps, you can run the bot using ***node index***. All content will be loaded into /downloads 

You can see work status in terminal
